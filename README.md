# Maggi-timer
A fun project for my sister who overcooks her maggi always

## ðŸŒŸ About the Project

This is my first ever website â€” designed and developed completely from scratch!  
I created everything myself, from the **UX design**, **custom illustrations**, and **icons**, to the **Figma prototype** and **final website implementation**.  

> A project that represents my learning journey, creativity, and dedication âœ¨  

If you would like to use any of the PNGs, icons, or visual assets from this project,

> *Designs and assets created by [https://github.com/m1s6ah]*
